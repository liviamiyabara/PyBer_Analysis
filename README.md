# PyBer_Analysis
Week 5 module, PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis
Pyber is a ride-sharing app company and in this challenge the Pyber Data Analyst needs to examine all the rideshare data from January to May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. The assessment will help the company improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability to underserved neighborhoods. 

The deliverable for this challenge is the creation of a multiple line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type (urban, suburban, rural) and recommendations on how to address disparities among city types. 

## Results

##### Summary Pyber Data

As per summary table above, majority of rides and drivers are in urban areas, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is lower in urban areas and higher in rural ones. Although the more than 80% of the drivers are concentrated in urban areas, only 63% of the total fares and 68% of the rides come from urban locations.

For the urban cities, there is a higher number of rides with a lower average fare, since urban areas are more densely populated, it is expected to have more journeys with lower distances. The opposite effect happens in rural areas, where the number of rides is lower and the average fare is higher, since people live farther away from each other. Below is the breakdown by city of the ride sharing data:

##### Pyber fare summary by week

Based on the chart above, besides the last week of February, where all city types had a peak of total revenues, each city type has a different behavior each week, for example, in the third week of January the total fare increased slightly for urban areas, it remained almost constant for the suburban areas and it dropped for rural locations.

## Summary

* Although rural areas represent the lowest revenues, it has the highest average fare per ride. Since the average fare per driver ($55.49) is way higher than the average fare per ride ($34.62), it could indicate the potential of growth by onboarding new drivers to increase coverage in the rural segment
* The average fare per driver is significant lower in urban areas ($16.57) and more than 80% of the drivers are in large cities, this could indicate a higher supply of drivers compared to the demand of rides. An increase in the urban fare could help drivers increase their earnings.
* For specific dates where Pyber expects a decrease in the number of rides, the company should do marketing campaigns with discounts to promote the app and increase the number of rides.  More historical data from previous years is needed to determine specific days where demand is low.
