# PyBer_Analysis
Week 5 module, PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis
Pyber is a ride-sharing app company and in this challenge the Pyber Data Analyst needs to examine all the rideshare data from January to May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. The assessment will help the company improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability to underserved neighborhoods. 

The deliverable for this challenge is the creation of a multiple line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type (urban, suburban, rural) and recommendations on how to address disparities among city types. 

## Results

For the urban cities, there is a higher number of rides with a lower average fare, since urban areas are more densely populated, it is expected to have more journeys with lower distances. The opposite effect happens in rural areas, where the number of rides is lower and the average fare is higher, since people live farther away from each other.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.


## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
